I will be uploading my data science learning @ R ,in this repository

Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is Lipsa Jena's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
Loads both the training and test datasets.
Extract only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidydata.txt.
