```{r}
gsa <- read.delim("../data/GSAF5.csv.bz2")
```

we loaded the shark file. It contains `r nrow(gsa)`  rows  and `r  ncol(gsa)` columns

Variable names in the data:
```{r}
names(gsa)
```

First few lines of data
```{r}
head(gsa, 3)
```

Analyze the type of attack:
```{r}
table(gsa$Type)
```

Extraxt subset of data: only provoked attacks:
```{r}
provoked <- gsa[gsa$Type == "Provoked",]
nrow(provoked)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
